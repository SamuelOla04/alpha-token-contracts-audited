ALPHA Token Smart Contracts Security Audit Report
Executive Summary

The ALPHA Token smart contracts have successfully passed a comprehensive security audit with zero vulnerabilities.

Audit Journey: From 6 Issues to Zero

During the initial review, six critical vulnerabilities were identified. Each was systematically addressed, retested, and resolved. The final audit confirms that all issues have been fixed, resulting in secure and production-ready contracts.

Bottom Line: The contracts are secure, efficient, and deployment-ready.

Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed (Pre-Audit)

Precision Loss in Reward Calculations – Fixed mathematical precision issues in staking rewards

Reward Token Exhaustion – Added balance checks and overflow protection

Access Control Flaws – Strengthened owner-only restrictions and validation

Double Release Tracking – Corrected vesting release accounting inconsistencies

Timestamp Manipulation Risks – Replaced timestamps with block-based logic

Revocation Token Return – Implemented correct token return on revocation

All vulnerabilities were fixed, tested, and verified before the final audit.

Remediation Process

Code Review – Full analysis of contract logic and attack vectors

Vulnerability Identification – Six critical issues identified

Fix Implementation – Security improvements applied to each issue

Testing – Verified fixes with functionality and security tests

Verification – Final audit confirmed all issues resolved
